Task 12 – Windows Security Event Log Analysis (Part A)

This task focuses on analyzing Windows Security Event Logs to identify
failed authentication attempts using Event Viewer.

The analysis was performed on a Windows 11 system in a controlled,
educational environment. Only Part A of the task was completed as per
instructions, and Part B was intentionally excluded.

Steps Performed:
- Opened Windows Event Viewer
- Navigated to Windows Logs → Security
- Used the "Filter Current Log" feature
- Applied Event ID 4625 to identify failed login attempts
- Reviewed log entries such as timestamp, account name, logon type,
  and failure reason

Observations:
- Event ID 4625 represents failed logon attempts
- Logs provide valuable information for detecting unauthorized access
- Filtering logs simplifies security investigation
- Event Viewer is an effective built-in Windows security tool

Limitations:
- Only Part A was performed
- No advanced log correlation or scripting was used
- No external tools were involved

Conclusion:
This task successfully demonstrated how to analyze Windows Security logs
to detect failed authentication attempts. The activity improved
understanding of log-based security monitoring and incident awareness.
